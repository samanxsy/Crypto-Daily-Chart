# Crypto-Daily-Chart
A program that fetches the market data of a specified cryptocurrency and plots the candlestick chart using the CoinGecko API.


## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- CoinGecko API key
- pandas
- plotly
